# Path-Following-Control-of-Wheeled-Robots-with-Actuator-Velocity-Saturations
kinematics path-following algorithm that drives a unicycle-type robot to a desired path, respecting velocity saturation constraint on the actuators. The solution, based on an extension of a globally convergent nonsingular path following solution, is formally shown. Simple conditions for the selection of the gains are provided.
